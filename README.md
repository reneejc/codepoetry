Code Poetry Workshop from 'Coalesce, Compose than Radiate' - November 7 2013 - London

This workshop will treat the logic of coding, rather than the specifics of its language, through the lens of 
narrative and poetry. How, through exploration and creation instead of demonstration, can we learn to take control 
of the devices that we use everyday? Throughout the workshop, participants will be able to create code that is 
immediately readable as poetry, which also compiles or is executable.
